<h1>The Making of Chocolate</h1>

<h2>Beginnings - Where Chocolate Grows</h2>
<p>
Chocolate comes from the fruit of the Cacao tree. The cacao tree grows in high humid, warm tropical locations of the world.
The cacao beans are the seeds to the cacao pods that grow on the cacao trees. People use long poles with blades on the
end to cut off the pods from the trees and collect the pods in central areas on the farms. The pods are cut open and the
beans are removed into piles. The beans are then placed in wooden boxes to ferment for five to seven.
</p>
 
<p>
After the fermentation process the beans are then dried and shipped to the chocolate factories.
</p>

<h2>At The Chocolate Factory - Cleaning, Roasting, and Grinding</h2>
<p>
The beans arrive at the choclate factory to go through a long rigorous process to turn the beans into beautiful
brown bars of chocolate as we know it. First, the beans are cleaned to remove any foreign items from the beans.
Then the beans go through the roasting process. This process develops flavor for the beans.
(Now the beans smell and taste like chocolate.)
</p>
<p>
The beans are then crushed into little piece and the shell is blown away in a winnower leaving behind the pieces
of bean called cocoa nibs. The nibs are then ground up into a liquid paste and then sent through a mixture were
the sugar, cocoa butter, and other ingredients are added.
